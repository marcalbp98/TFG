The repository is divided in: 
> examples from Sarkka book to introduce to then Bayesian inference world
Models:
 >1 - One population
	_2_2 is the latest updated file
	_3 is the file for the RMSE run.
 >2  - One population + SD
 	_2 is the latest updated file
	_3 is the file for the RMSE run.
 >3  - Two populations with SD
	_2 is the latest updated file
	_3 is the file for the RMSE run.
All models have the activationfunction.m
>RMSE: with only the RMSE.m scripts to calculate for each model
Parameter inference: only one file with the implemented GHKF for prm1

prm means population rate model,
kf means kalman filter, added if at any time we decided to use other bayesian inference methods.
_3 is the file for the RMSE run.
